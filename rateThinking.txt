make a calibration period for the setup phase for tracking frame rate calc



$$$$
1) make initial finding of frame number increase by 28's so we are right on the edge
2) make the cfr start way too slow (be really big)
3) fill up rateList with 200 fails (0's) (as if we're waiting forever), set rateTracker=0
4) on each new frame:
	int past = rateList.back();
	rateList.pop_back();
	if(success)
	{
		rateList.push_front(1);
		if(past != 1)
		{
			rateTracker++;
		}
	}
	else
	{
		rateList.push_front(0);
		if(past != 0)
		{
			rateTracker--;
		}
	}

5) if (frameCount%25 == 0)
{
	// do what's described below
	// if(rateCount > 40) ...
}

track last 200, check every 25:
> 40 fails, speed up sample rate -> decrease cfr
< 15 fails, slow down sample rate -> increase cfr
if(10 fails in row) hard reset + slow down sample rate (increase cfr)
